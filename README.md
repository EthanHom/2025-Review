# 2025-Review

**Review/Practice place for coding (interviews, etc.)**


**Core Topics:**

Data Structures:
- Arrays, Strings
- Linked Lists (singly, doubly, circular)
- Stacks and Queues
- Hash Tables / Hash Maps
- Trees (Binary, Binary Search, AVL, Red-Black, Segment, Trie)
- Graphs (adjacency list/matrix, DFS, BFS, shortest paths)
- Heaps / Priority Queues
- Sets (HashSet, TreeSet)

**Coding Practice**

Don't forget to practice LeetCode, HackerRank, Codeforces, CodeChef, AtCoder, Project Euler, etc. (Particularly on Arrays and Strings, Recursion and Backtracking, Graph Traversal, Dynamic Programming, Sliding Window + Two Pointers + Greedy approaches)


**Comp Sci Fundamentals:**

Big-O Notation:
- Analyze time and space complexity of algorithms.
- Common complexities: O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n²), O(2ⁿ), O(n!).

Operating Systems:
- Understand threading, multithreading, process scheduling, memory management, and deadlocks.

Networking:
- Basics of HTTP/HTTPS, TCP/IP, DNS, and REST APIs.
- Familiarity with load balancing and CDN.

Databases:
- Basic SQL queries (SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, etc.).
- Indexing and optimization.
- Difference between SQL and NoSQL.
